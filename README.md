# Movement Unlocker

A Counter-Strike 2 Metamod plugin that removes the max speed limitation from players on the ground, feels like CS:S. Useful for zombie knockback, several movement gamemodes, or just easier bhop.

Ported from the [Movement Unlocker](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=255298) SourceMod plugin for CS:GO.
